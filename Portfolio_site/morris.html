            <h4>Overview / Artists Statment</h4>
            <p>
                As the dedication page says, this book is “to all those whose talent is lost to history”. Originally interested in the origins of what we know today as arts and crafts, I quickly found and became fascinated with the Arts and Crafts movement of the late 1800’s. However, the more I read, the more I noticed one key thing. Any mention of the women of the movement was brief, and usually in relation to a husband or father. This was surprising to me, as although this movement is different from the modern idea of arts and crafts, today the term is very much associated with women & the 
                feminine. While the book is directly about May Morris and her work, more broadly it is about all the women 
                throughout history that were not given the recognition they deserved due to their gender. With vellum, I was 
                able to overlay her designs on images of the final product, highlighting her ability to not only design 
                beautifully, but also execute those designs. Just as one must be intentional about uncovering the stories 
                of these women, the reader of this book must be intentional and take care to uncover the middle informational 
                pages. While practicing their hand at embroidery, the reader stitches and un-stitches the pages, eventually 
                uncovering May. This book was inspired by the work of May Morris, specifically her instructional book titled 
                Decorative Needlework. Other books that I took inspiration from throughout the process include Praise Basted 
                In. A Friendship Quilt for Aunt Sallie by Margaret Kaufman and Rondo by Robbin Ami Silverberg.

            <h4>Process</h4>
            <p>To create the book itself, I was able to explore the Book Arts Lab here at Wellesley. Using the various tools available, I created everything from scratch. I learnt how to bind the book, create its cover, align the pages, etc. 
                <br>
                For the content of the pages, I used a mixture of Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign. I gathered the images using online resources and by scanning books collected in the Art Library and Interlibrary Loan system 
                <br>
                It took a lot of trial and error to get the pages aligned, especially when using the velum to emphasize the outlines of each finished piece.
