         <h4>Overview</h4>
         <p>For this project, I was working to create my own personal utopian space, interpreting however I pleased. When imagining what the perfect space would be for me, the number one requirement was quiet. I often find myself frustrated by noises out of my control, be it a lawn mower outside or a neighbor talking loudly on the other side of the wall. Therefore, I created a space in which I would be able to, in theory, block out the noise of the world and relax. This project allowed me to use my imagination and creativity to solve a real problem I face, but still kept it lighthearted. Additionally, this project introduced me to a new medium, and allowed me to begin learning the art of woodworking. </p>

         <h4>Process</h4>
         <p><b>Planning/Idea</b><br>
             As with most projects, I began working on this model in my sketchbook. After brainstorming the way in which sound affects me, I did some brief research on how sound travels. I was inspired by the foam egg cartons that are often placed in recording studios, but discovered they are designed to keep sound in. As I wanted to keep sound out, I decided to put a facade on my model that mimicked this idea, only I placed it on the outside in order to play off the actual physics. Additionally, I learned that the thicker something is, the less sound can travel through it. Not wanting my model to feel like a cell, I added two ‘glass’ walls that would be about 1 foot thick. This way, I would be able to not feel cut off, but have a place where I was ensured peace.<br>
             <b>Construction</b><br>
             In order to construct my model, I settled on building it from wood and acrylic at a 7/8” to 1’ scale, working within the confines of the preset acrylic thickness. Next, I began my training in the woodshop, and was able to create the various pieces using a miter saw, band saw and table saw. I found this tested my own confidence in my abilities, as I had never used any power tools before. However, I left feeling extremely gratified and was proud of my ability to overcome the challenge. While I struggled to perfect the exact measurements at first, I was able to preserve and rework the piece until it was to my liking.
